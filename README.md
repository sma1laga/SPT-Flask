# Signal Processing Toolkit

**Signal Processing Toolkit (SPT-Flask)** is an interactive, browser-based environment for exploring classic and modern DSP concepts.  The project grew from a simple plotting tool into a full learning platform with simulation and training modules.

**GitHub Repository:** [SPT-Flask](https://github.com/sma1laga/SPT-Flask)

## ðŸ“š About the Project

The application is organised as a set of small Flask blueprints, each covering a
particular DSP topic. Students and hobbyists can:

- Plot and analyse continuous or discrete signals in real time
- Perform convolution, autocorrelation and Fourier analysis
- Visualise Bode plots, inverse transforms and kernel animations
- Model systems with process chains or editable block diagrams
- Design filters with speech and image demos and experiment with modulation
- Practise using the built-in training pages and exam modules

The goal is a **practical, hands-on toolkit** that supports university courses and self-study alike.
