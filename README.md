# Signal Processing Toolkit (SPT‑Flask)

**SPT‑Flask** is a modern, browser‑based environment for learning and experimenting with digital and analogue signal‑processing concepts. It was created at the Lehrstuhl für Multimediale Signalverarbeitung (LMS), FAU Erlangen‑Nürnberg and is provided licence‑free for educational and research use.

## 🎯 Project goals

* Make complex DSP topics approachable through interactive visualisation.
* Provide a one‑stop toolkit for plotting, transforms, convolution, filtering and modulation.
* Support discrete‑ and continuous‑time analysis within a unified interface.
* Offer training modules and exam‑style quizzes for self‑assessment.
* Encourage community contributions and recognise those who improve the toolkit.

## 🚀 Features

### Plotting & analysis

* Time‑domain function plotter with adjustable parameters.
* Continuous and discrete Fourier transform calculators (including FFT and DFT viewers).
* Autocorrelation visualiser and kernel animator.
* Bode‑plot generator for continuous‑time systems.
* Inverse Laplace and Z‑transform calculators.
* Image spectrum viewer and transform‑table reference.

### Convolution & filtering

* Continuous, discrete and dynamic convolution calculators.
* Custom filter designer with downloadable impulse responses.
* Speech filter design and spectrogram analysis.
* Image‑filter demo supporting low‑pass/high‑pass/band‑pass Butterworth filters.
* Advanced noise‑reduction module using wavelet processing.

### System modelling

* Process‑chain simulator that lets you chain basic DSP blocks and view intermediate outputs.
* Block‑diagram editor and direct‑form visualiser.
* Kernel animator to illustrate impulse responses.

### Modulation

* Analog modulation examples (AM, FM).
* Digital modulation demos (ASK, PSK, FSK) with adjustable carrier frequency, bit rate and deviation.

### Discrete‑time tools

* Plot discrete sequences and explore Z‑transform intuition.
* Perform discrete convolution and autocorrelation.
* FFT/DFT and discrete dynamic convolution demos.

### Learning aids

* Training modules for convolution, Fourier transforms and process‑chain design.
* Small exam modules with timed questions and feedback.
* Downloadable plots and data for offline study.
* All pages support dark mode and colour‑blind mode.

### Analytics & stability

* A lightweight analytics component collects anonymous usage statistics (path, user agent, country) to improve the service.
* Crash logging records unhandled exceptions for debugging; no personal data are stored.
